# poo-toolbox

Tool box for implementing an object-based approach in embedded programming.

As we will use the [piduino](https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino) library whose 
API is compatible with Arduino, we can also perform its activities with an 
Arduino board (with some adaptations that will be reported).
